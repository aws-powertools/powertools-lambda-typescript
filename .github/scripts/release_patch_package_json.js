/**
 * This script is used to update the package.json file of an utility to include pre-release suffixes
 * and remove fields that are not needed in the tarball that will be published to npm.
 *
 * We read the original package.json file and extract all the fields. Then, if the is an
 * alpha or beta package, we update the version number to include a suffix. Finally, we write the updated
 * package.json file to disk that includes the patched version number and all the fields we want to keep.
 *
 * The file will be restored to its original state after the release is complete.
