# Powertools for AWS Lambda (TypeScript) - Batch Processing Utility

Powertools for AWS Lambda (TypeScript) is a developer toolkit to implement Serverless [best practices and increase developer velocity](https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda/typescript/latest/#features).

You can use the library in both TypeScript and JavaScript code bases.

## Intro

The Batch Processing utility handles partial failures when processing batches from Amazon SQS, Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, and Amazon DynamoDB Streams.

## Usage

To get started, install the library by running:

```sh
npm i @aws-lambda-powertools/batch
```

### Batch Processor

When using SQS, Kinesis Data Streams, or DynamoDB Streams as a Lambda event source, your Lambda functions are triggered with a batch of messages.

If your function fails to process any message from the batch, the entire batch returns to your queue or stream. This same batch is then retried until either condition happens first: **a)** your Lambda function returns a successful response, **b)** record reaches maximum retry attempts, or **c)** when records expire.

With this utility, batch records are processed individually â€“ only messages that failed to be processed return to the queue or stream for a further retry.

### SQS Processor

When using SQS as a Lambda event source, you can specify the `EventType.SQS` to process the records. The response will be a `SQSBatchResponse` which contains a list of items that failed to be processed.

```ts
import {
  BatchProcessorSync,
  EventType,
  processPartialResponseSync,
} from '@aws-lambda-powertools/batch';
import { Logger } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/logger';
import type { SQSHandler, SQSRecord } from 'aws-lambda';

const processor = new BatchProcessorSync(EventType.SQS);
const logger = new Logger();

const recordHandler = (record: SQSRecord): void => {
  const payload = record.body;
  if (payload) {
    const item = JSON.parse(payload);
    logger.info('Processed item', { item });
  }
};

export const handler: SQSHandler = async (event, context) => 
  processPartialResponseSync(event, recordHandler, processor, {
    context,
  });
```

### Kinesis Processor

When using Kinesis Data Streams as a Lambda event source, you can specify the `EventType.KinesisDataStreams` to process the records. The response will be a `KinesisStreamBatchResponse` which contains a list of items that failed to be processed.

```ts
import {
  BatchProcessorSync,
  EventType,
  processPartialResponseSync,
} from '@aws-lambda-powertools/batch';
import { Logger } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/logger';
import type { KinesisStreamHandler, KinesisStreamRecord } from 'aws-lambda';

const processor = new BatchProcessorSync(EventType.KinesisDataStreams);
const logger = new Logger();

const recordHandler = (record: KinesisStreamRecord): void => {
  logger.info('Processing record', { record: record.kinesis.data });
  const payload = JSON.parse(record.kinesis.data);
  logger.info('Processed item', { item: payload });
};

export const handler: KinesisStreamHandler = async (event, context) => 
  processPartialResponseSync(event, recordHandler, processor, {
    context,
  });
```

### DynamoDB Streams Processor

When using DynamoDB Streams as a Lambda event source, you can use the `BatchProcessorSync` with the `EventType.DynamoDBStreams` to process the records. The response will be a `DynamoDBBatchResponse` which contains a list of items that failed to be processed.

```ts
import {
  BatchProcessor,
  EventType,
  processPartialResponseSync,
} from '@aws-lambda-powertools/batch';
import { Logger } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/logger';
import type { DynamoDBRecord, DynamoDBStreamHandler } from 'aws-lambda';

const processor = new BatchProcessor(EventType.DynamoDBStreams); // (1)!
const logger = new Logger();

const recordHandler = (record: DynamoDBRecord): void => {
  if (record.dynamodb && record.dynamodb.NewImage) {
    logger.info('Processing record', { record: record.dynamodb.NewImage });
    const message = record.dynamodb.NewImage.Message.S;
    if (message) {
      const payload = JSON.parse(message);
      logger.info('Processed item', { item: payload });
    }
  }
};

export const handler: DynamoDBStreamHandler = async (event, context) =>
  processPartialResponseSync(event, recordHandler, processor, {
    context,
  });
```

### Async processing

If your use case allows you to process multiple records at the same time without conflicting with each other, you can use the `BatchProcessor` to process records asynchronously. This will create an array of promises that will be resolved once all records have been processed.

```ts
import {
  BatchProcessor,
  EventType,
  processPartialResponse,
} from '@aws-lambda-powertools/batch';
import type { SQSHandler, SQSRecord } from 'aws-lambda';

const processor = new BatchProcessor(EventType.SQS);

const recordHandler = async (record: SQSRecord): Promise<number> => {
  const res = await fetch('https://httpbin.org/anything', {
    body: JSON.stringify({ message: record.body }),
  });

  return res.status;
};

export const handler: SQSHandler = async (event, context) => 
  await processPartialResponse(event, recordHandler, processor, {
    context,
  });
```
