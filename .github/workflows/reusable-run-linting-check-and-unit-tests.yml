name: Run unit tests

# 
# PROCESS
#
# 1. Checkout code
# 2. Install dependencies & build project
# 3. Run linting
# 4. Run unit tests
#
# NOTES
# We create different jobs for different workspaces of the monorepo, since we have slightly different requirements for each.
# For example, the docs (`check-docs`), runs markdown linting, while the layer (`check-layer-publisher`), examples (`check-examples`),
# and code snippets (`check-docs-snippets`) jobs run linting and unit tests but only for the current LTS version of Node.js.
#
# For the Powertools for AWS main features (aka `packages/*`), instead we run linting and unit tests for all the supported
# versions of Node.js.
#
# Since #2938, we are in the process of improving our test suite, so we are gradually extracting the tests for each package
# from (`run-linting-check-and-unit-tests-on-utilities`) to their own job, so we can run them in parallel using the matrix
# strategy and reduce the time it takes to run the tests, as well as improve maintainer experience in case of failures.
# 
# USAGE
#
# NOTE: meant to be called by ./.github/workflows/pr-run-linting-check-and-unit-tests.yml when a PR is opened or updated,
# or by ./.github/workflows/make-release.yml when a release is made.
