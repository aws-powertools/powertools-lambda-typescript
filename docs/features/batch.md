```

## Key features

* Reports batch item failures to reduce number of retries for a record upon errors
* Simple interface to process each batch record
* Build your own batch processor by extending primitives

## Background

When using SQS, Kinesis Data Streams, or DynamoDB Streams as a Lambda event source, your Lambda functions are triggered with a batch of messages.

If your function fails to process any message from the batch, the entire batch returns to your queue or stream. This same batch is then retried until either condition happens first: **a)** your Lambda function returns a successful response, **b)** record reaches maximum retry attempts, or **c)** when records expire.

```mermaid
journey
  section Conditions
    Successful response: 5: Success
    Maximum retries: 3: Failure
    Records expired: 1: Failure
```

This behavior changes when you enable [ReportBatchItemFailures feature](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs.html#services-sqs-batchfailurereporting) in your Lambda function event source configuration:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
* [**SQS queues**](#sqs-standard). Only messages reported as failure will return to the queue for a retry, while successful ones will be deleted.
* [**Kinesis data streams**](#kinesis-and-dynamodb-streams) and [**DynamoDB streams**](#kinesis-and-dynamodb-streams). Single reported failure will use its sequence number as the stream checkpoint. Multiple  reported failures will use the lowest sequence number as checkpoint.

???+ warning "Warning: This utility lowers the chance of processing records more than once; it does not guarantee it"
    We recommend implementing processing logic in an [idempotent manner](idempotency.md){target="_blank"} wherever possible.

    You can find more details on how Lambda works with either [SQS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs.html){target="_blank"}, [Kinesis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-kinesis.html){target="_blank"}, or [DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-ddb.html){target="_blank"} in the AWS Documentation.

## Getting started

### Installation

Install the library in your project

```shell
npm i @aws-lambda-powertools/batch
```

For this feature to work, you need to **(1)** configure your Lambda function event source to use `ReportBatchItemFailures`, and **(2)** return [a specific response](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs.html#services-sqs-batchfailurereporting){target="_blank" rel="nofollow"} to report which records failed to be processed.

Use your preferred deployment framework to set the correct configuration while this utility handles the correct response to be returned.

### Required resources

The remaining sections of the documentation will rely on these samples. For completeness, this demonstrates IAM permissions and Dead Letter Queue where batch records will be sent after 2 retries.

!!! note "You do not need any additional IAM permissions to use this utility, except for what each event source requires."

    --8<-- "examples/snippets/batch/templates/sam/dynamodb.yaml"
    ```

### Processing messages from SQS

Processing batches from SQS works in three stages:

1. Instantiate **`BatchProcessor`** and choose **`EventType.SQS`** for the event type
2. Define your function to handle each batch record, and use the `SQSRecord` type annotation for autocompletion
3. Use **`processPartialResponse`** to kick off processing

???+ info
    This code example optionally uses Logger for completion.

=== "index.ts"

    ```typescript hl_lines="1-5 9 12 21-23"
    --8<--
     examples/snippets/batch/gettingStartedSQS.ts::11
     examples/snippets/batch/gettingStartedSQS.ts:13:21
     examples/snippets/batch/gettingStartedSQS.ts:23:25
    --8<--
    ```

    1.  **Step 1**. Creates a partial failure batch processor for SQS queues. See [partial failure mechanics for details](#partial-failure-mechanics)
    2.  **Step 2**. Defines a function to receive one record at a time from the batch
    3.  **Step 3**. Kicks off processing   

=== "Sample response"

    The second record failed to be processed, therefore the processor added its message ID in the response.

    ```json
    --8<-- "examples/snippets/batch/samples/sampleSQSResponse.json"
    ```

=== "Sample event"

    ```json
    --8<-- "examples/snippets/batch/samples/sampleSQSEvent.json"
    ```

#### FIFO queues

When using [SQS FIFO queues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-fifo-queues.html){target="_blank"}, a batch may include messages from different group IDs.

By default, we will stop processing at the first failure and mark unprocessed messages as failed to preserve ordering. However, this behavior may not be optimal for customers who wish to proceed with processing messages from a different group ID.

Enable the `skipGroupOnError` option for seamless processing of messages from various group IDs. This setup ensures that messages from a failed group ID are sent back to SQS, enabling uninterrupted processing of messages from the subsequent group ID.

=== "Recommended"

    ```typescript hl_lines="1-4 8 20"
    --8<-- "examples/snippets/batch/gettingStartedSQSFifo.ts"
    ```

    ```typescript hl_lines="1-4 13 30"

!!! Note
    Note that `SqsFifoPartialProcessor` is synchronous using `processPartialResponseSync`.
    If you need asynchronous processing while preserving the order of messages in the queue, use `SqsFifoPartialProcessorAsync` with `processPartialResponse`.

### Processing messages from Kinesis

Processing batches from Kinesis works in three stages:

1. Instantiate **`BatchProcessor`** and choose **`EventType.KinesisDataStreams`** for the event type
2. Define your function to handle each batch record, and use the `KinesisStreamRecord` type annotation for autocompletion
3. Use **`processPartialResponse`** to kick off processing

???+ info

=== "index.ts"

    ```typescript hl_lines="1-5 9 12 19-21"

    ```

    1.  Creates a partial failure batch processor for Kinesis Data Streams. See [partial failure mechanics for details](#partial-failure-mechanics)

=== "Sample response"

    The second record failed to be processed, therefore the processor added its sequence number in the response.

    ```json
    --8<-- "examples/snippets/batch/samples/sampleKinesisEvent.json"
    ```

=== "Sample event"

    ```json
    --8<-- "examples/snippets/batch/samples/sampleKinesisResponse.json"
    ```

### Processing messages from DynamoDB

Processing batches from DynamoDB Streams works in three stages:

1. Instantiate **`BatchProcessor`** and choose **`EventType.DynamoDBStreams`** for the event type
2. Define your function to handle each batch record, and use the `DynamoDBRecord` type annotation for autocompletion
3. Use **`processPartialResponse`** to kick off processing

???+ info
    This code example optionally uses Logger for completion.

=== "index.ts"

    ```typescript hl_lines="1-5 9 12 24-26"
    --8<-- "examples/snippets/batch/gettingStartedDynamoDBStreams.ts"
    ```

    1.  Creates a partial failure batch processor for DynamoDB Streams. See [partial failure mechanics for details](#partial-failure-mechanics)

=== "Sample response"

    The second record failed to be processed, therefore the processor added its sequence number in the response.

    ```json
    --8<-- "examples/snippets/batch/samples/sampleDynamoDBStreamsResponse.json"
    ```

=== "Sample event"

    ```json
    --8<-- "examples/snippets/batch/samples/sampleDynamoDBStreamsEvent.json"
    ```

### Error handling

By default, we catch any exception raised by your record handler function. This allows us to **(1)** continue processing the batch, **(2)** collect each batch item that failed processing, and **(3)** return the appropriate  response correctly without failing your Lambda function execution.

=== "Sample error handling with custom exception"

    ```typescript hl_lines="25"
    --8<--
     examples/snippets/batch/gettingStartedErrorHandling.ts::24
     examples/snippets/batch/gettingStartedErrorHandling.ts:26:30
     examples/snippets/batch/gettingStartedErrorHandling.ts:32:
    --8<--
    ```

    1. Any exception works here. See [extending BatchProcessorSync section, if you want to override this behavior.](#extending-batchprocessor)

    2. Exceptions raised in `recordHandler` will propagate to `process_partial_response`. <br/><br/> We catch them and include each failed batch item identifier in the response dictionary (see `Sample response` tab).

=== "Sample response"

    ```json
    --8<-- "examples/snippets/batch/samples/sampleSQSResponse.json"
    ```

### Partial failure mechanics

All records in the batch will be passed to this handler for processing, even if exceptions are thrown - Here's the behaviour after completing the batch:

* **All records successfully processed**. We will return an empty list of item failures `{'batchItemFailures': []}`
* **Partial success with some exceptions**. We will return a list of all item IDs/sequence numbers that failed processing
* **All records failed to be processed**. We will throw a `FullBatchFailureError` error with a list of all the errors thrown while processing unless `throwOnFullBatchFailure` is disabled.

The following sequence diagrams explain how each Batch processor behaves under different scenarios.

Sequence diagram to explain how `BatchProcessor` works with both [Kinesis Data Streams](#processing-messages-from-kinesis) and [DynamoDB Streams](#processing-messages-from-dynamodb).

For brevity, we will use `Streams` to refer to either services. For theory on stream checkpoints, see this [blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/optimizing-batch-processing-with-custom-checkpoints-in-aws-lambda/){target="_blank"}

The behavior changes slightly when there are multiple item failures. Stream checkpoint is updated to the lowest sequence number reported.

### Async or sync processing

There are two processors you can use with this utility:

* **`BatchProcessor`** and **`processPartialResponse`** – Processes messages asynchronously
* **`BatchProcessorSync`** and **`processPartialResponseSync`** – Processes messages synchronously

In most cases your function will be `async` returning a `Promise`. Therefore, the `BatchProcessor` is the default processor handling your batch records asynchronously.
There are use cases where you need to process the batch records synchronously. For example, when you need to process multiple records at the same time without conflicting with one another.
For such cases we recommend to use the `BatchProcessorSync` and `processPartialResponseSync` functions.

!!! info "Note that you need match your processing function with the right batch processor"
    *If your function is `async` returning a `Promise`, use `BatchProcessor` and `processPartialResponse`
    * If your function is not `async`, use `BatchProcessorSync` and `processPartialResponseSync`

The difference between the two processors is in how they handle record processing:

* **`BatchProcessor`**: By default, it processes records in parallel using `Promise.all()`. However, it also offers an [option](#sequential-async-processing) to process records sequentially, preserving the order.
* **`BatchProcessorSync`**: Always processes records sequentially, ensuring the order is preserved by looping through each record one by one.

???+ question "When is this useful?"

    For example, imagine you need to process multiple loyalty points and incrementally save in a database. While you await the database to confirm your records are saved, you could start processing another request concurrently.

    The reason this is not the default behaviour is that not all use cases can handle concurrency safely (e.g., loyalty points must be updated in order).

## Advanced

### Accessing processed messages

Use the `BatchProcessor` directly in your function to access a list of all returned values from your `recordHandler` function.

* **When successful**. We will include a tuple with `success`, the result of `recordHandler`, and the batch record
* **When failed**. We will include a tuple with `fail`, exception as a string, and the batch record

```typescript hl_lines="17 19-20 23 28" title="Accessing processed messages"
--8<-- "examples/snippets/batch/accessProcessedMessages.ts"
```

1. The processor requires the records array. This is typically handled by `processPartialResponse`.
2. You need to register the `batch`, the `recordHandler` function, and optionally the `context` to access the Lambda context.

### Accessing Lambda Context

Within your `recordHandler` function, you might need access to the Lambda context to determine how much time you have left before your function times out.

We can automatically inject the [Lambda context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/typescript-context.html){target="_blank"} into your `recordHandler` as optional second argument if you register it when using `BatchProcessorSync` or the `processPartialResponseSync` function.

```typescript hl_lines="12 27"
--8<-- "examples/snippets/batch/accessLambdaContext.ts"
```

### Working with full batch failures

By default, the `BatchProcessor` will throw a `FullBatchFailureError` if all records in the batch fail to process, we do this to reflect the failure in your operational metrics.

When working with functions that handle batches with a small number of records, or when you use errors as a flow control mechanism, this behavior might not be desirable as your function might generate an unnaturally high number of errors. When this happens, the [Lambda service will scale down the concurrency of your function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-sqs-errorhandling.html#services-sqs-backoff-strategy){target="_blank"}, potentially impacting performance.

For these scenarios, you can set the `throwOnFullBatchFailure` option to `false` when calling.

```typescript hl_lines="17"
--8<-- "examples/snippets/batch/noThrowOnFullBatchFailure.ts"
```

### Extending BatchProcessor

You might want to bring custom logic to the existing `BatchProcessor` to slightly override how we handle successes and failures.

For these scenarios, you can subclass `BatchProcessor` and quickly override `successHandler` and `failureHandler` methods:

* **`successHandler()`** – Keeps track of successful batch records
* **`failureHandler()`** – Keeps track of failed batch records

Let's suppose you'd like to add a metric named `BatchRecordFailures` for each batch record that failed processing

```typescript hl_lines="3 15 19 26 32" title="Extending failure handling mechanism in BatchProcessor"
--8<-- "examples/snippets/batch/extendingFailure.ts"
```

### Sequential async processing

By default, the `BatchProcessor` processes records in parallel using `Promise.all()`. However, if you need to preserve the order of records, you can set the `processInParallel` option to `false` to process records sequentially.

!!! important "If the `processInParallel` option is not provided, the `BatchProcessor` will process records in parallel."

```typescript hl_lines="8 17" title="Sequential async processing"
--8<-- "examples/snippets/batch/sequentialAsyncProcessing.ts"
```

### Create your own partial processor

You can create your own partial batch processor from scratch by inheriting the `BasePartialProcessor` class, and implementing the `prepare()`, `clean()`, `processRecord()` and `processRecordSync()` abstract methods.

<center>
```mermaid
classDiagram
    direction LR
    class BasePartialProcessor {
        <<interface>>
        +prepare()
        +clean()
        +processRecord(record: BaseRecord)
        +processRecordSync(record: BaseRecord)
    }
    class YourCustomProcessor {
        +prepare()
        +clean()
        +processRecord(record: BaseRecord)
        +processRecordSyc(record: BaseRecord)
    }
    BasePartialProcessor <|-- YourCustomProcessor : extends
```
<i>Visual representation to bring your own processor</i>
</center>

* **`prepare()`** – called once as part of the processor initialization
* **`clean()`** – teardown logic called once after `processRecord` completes
* **`processRecord()`** – If you need to implement asynchronous logic, use this method, otherwise define it in your class with empty logic
* **`processRecordSync()`** – handles all processing logic for each individual message of a batch, including calling the `recordHandler` (`this.handler`)

You can then use this class as a context manager, or pass it to `processPartialResponseSync` to process the records in your Lambda handler function.

```typescript hl_lines="21 35 55 60 72 85" title="Creating a custom batch processor"
--8<-- "examples/snippets/batch/customPartialProcessor.ts"
```

## Tracing with AWS X-Ray

You can use Tracer to create subsegments for each batch record processed. To do so, you can open a new subsegment for each record, and close it when you're done processing it. When adding annotations and metadata to the subsegment, you can do so directly without calling `tracer.setSegment(subsegment)`. This allows you to work with the subsegment directly and avoid having to either pass the parent subsegment around or have to restore the parent subsegment at the end of the record processing.

```typescript
--8<-- "examples/snippets/batch/advancedTracingRecordHandler.ts"
```

1. Retrieve the current segment, then create a subsegment for the record being processed
2. You can add annotations and metadata to the subsegment directly without calling `tracer.setSegment(subsegment)`
3. Close the subsegment when you're done processing the record

## Testing your code

As there is no external calls, you can unit test your code with `BatchProcessorSync` quite easily.

**Example**:

Given a SQS batch where the first batch record succeeds and the second fails processing, we should have a single item reported in the function response.
