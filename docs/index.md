## Features

### Using Lambda Layers

!!! note "Layers help us understand who uses Powertools for AWS Lambda (TypeScript) in a non-intrusive way."

When [using Layers](./getting-started/lambda-layers.md), you can add Powertools for AWS Lambda (TypeScript) as a dev dependency to not impact the development process. For Layers, we pre-package all dependencies, compile and optimize for storage.

## Tenets

These are our core principles to guide our decision making.

- __AWS Lambda only__. We optimise for AWS Lambda function environments and supported runtimes only. Utilities might work with web frameworks and non-Lambda environments, though they are not officially supported.
- __Eases the adoption of best practices__. The main priority of the utilities is to facilitate best practices adoption, as defined in the AWS Well-Architected Serverless Lens; all other functionality is optional.
- __Keep it lean__. Additional dependencies are carefully considered for security and ease of maintenance, and prevent negatively impacting startup time.
- __We strive for backwards compatibility__. New features and changes should keep backwards compatibility. If a breaking change cannot be avoided, the deprecation and migration process should be clearly defined.
- __We work backwards from the community__. We aim to strike a balance of what would work best for 80% of customers. Emerging practices are considered and discussed via Requests for Comment (RFCs)
- __Progressive__. Utilities are designed to be incrementally adoptable for customers at any stage of their Serverless journey. They follow language idioms and their communityâ€™s common practices.
