/**
 * Redis persistence layer for idempotency records.
 *
 * This class uses Redis to write and read idempotency records. It supports any Redis client that
 * implements the RedisCompatibleClient interface.
 *
 * There are various options to configure the persistence layer, such as attribute names for storing
 * status, expiry, data, and validation keys in Redis.
 *
 * You must provide your own connected Redis client instance by passing it through the `client` option.
 *
 * See the {@link https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda/typescript/latest/utilities/idempotency/ Idempotency documentation}
 * for more details on the Redis configuration and usage patterns.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { createClient } from '@redis/client';
 * import { RedisPersistenceLayer } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/idempotency/redis';
 * import { RedisCompatibleClient } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/idempotency/redis/types';
 *
 * const redisClient = createClient({ url: 'redis://localhost:6379' });
 * await redisClient.connect();
 *
 * const persistence = new RedisPersistenceLayer({
 *   client: redisClient as RedisCompatibleClient,
 * });
 * ```
 *
