# Powertools for AWS Lambda (TypeScript) - Validation Utility

This utility provides JSON Schema validation for events and responses, including JMESPath support to unwrap events before validation.

Powertools for AWS Lambda (TypeScript) is a developer toolkit to implement Serverless [best practices and increase developer velocity](https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda/typescript/latest/#features). You can use the library in both TypeScript and JavaScript code bases.

To get started, install the package by running:

```sh
npm i @aws-lambda-powertools/validation
```

## Features

You can validate inbound and outbound payloads using the `@validator` class method decorator or `validator` Middy.js middleware.

You can also use the standalone `validate` function, if you want more control over the validation process such as handling a validation error.

### Validator decorator

The `@validator` decorator is a TypeScript class method decorator that you can use to validate both the incoming event and the response payload.

If the validation fails, we will throw a `SchemaValidationError`.

```typescript
import { validator } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/validation/decorator';
import type { Context } from 'aws-lambda';

const inboundSchema = {
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    value: { type: 'number' },
  },
  required: ['value'],
  additionalProperties: false,
};

const outboundSchema = {
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    result: { type: 'number' },
  },
  required: ['result'],
  additionalProperties: false,
};

class Lambda {
  @validator({
    inboundSchema,
    outboundSchema,
  })
  async handler(event: { value: number }, _context: Context) {
    // Your handler logic here
    return { result: event.value * 2 };
  }
}

const lambda = new Lambda();
export const handler = lambda.handler.bind(lambda);
```

It's not mandatory to validate both the inbound and outbound payloads. You can either use one, the other, or both.

### Validator middleware

If you are using Middy.js, you can instead use the `validator` middleware to validate the incoming event and response payload.

```typescript
import { validator } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/validation/middleware';
import middy from '@middy/core';

const inboundSchema = {
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    foo: { type: 'string' },
  },
  required: ['foo'],
  additionalProperties: false,
};

const outboundSchema = {
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    bar: { type: 'number' },
  },
  required: ['bar'],
  additionalProperties: false,
};

export const handler = middy()
  .use(validation({ inboundSchema, outboundSchema }))
  .handler(async (event) => {
    // Your handler logic here
    return { bar: 42 };
  });
```

Like the `@validator` decorator, you can choose to validate only the inbound or outbound payload.

### Standalone validate function

The `validate` function gives you more control over the validation process, and is typically used within the Lambda handler, or any other function that needs to validate data.

When using the standalone function, you can gracefully handle schema validation errors by catching `SchemaValidationError` errors.

```typescript
import { validate } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/validation';
import { SchemaValidationError } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/validation/errors';

const schema = {
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    name: { type: 'string' },
    age: { type: 'number' },
  },
  required: ['name', 'age'],
  additionalProperties: false,
} as const;

const payload = { name: 'John', age: 30 };

export const handler = async (event: unknown) => {
  try {
    const validatedData = validate({
      payload,
      schema,
    });

    // Your handler logic here
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof SchemaValidationError) {
      // Handle the validation error
      return {
        statusCode: 400,
        body: JSON.stringify({ message: error.message }),
      };
    }
    // Handle other errors
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### JMESPath support

In some cases you might want to validate only a portion of the event payload - this is what the `envelope` option is for.

You can use JMESPath expressions to specify the path to the property you want to validate. The validator will unwrap the event before validating it.

```typescript
import { validate } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/validation';

const schema = {
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    user: { type: 'string' },
  },
  required: ['user'],
  additionalProperties: false,
} as const;

const payload = {
  data: {
    user: 'Alice',
  },
};

const validatedData = validate({
  payload,
  schema,
  envelope: 'data',
});
```

### Extending the validator

Since the validator is built on top of [Ajv](https://ajv.js.org/), you can extend it with custom formats and external schemas, as well as bringing your own `ajv` instance.

The example below shows how to pass additional options to the `validate` function, but you can also pass them to the `@validator` decorator and `validator` middleware.

```typescript
import { validate } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/validation';

const formats = {
  ageRange: (value: number) => return value >= 0 && value <= 120,
};

const definitionSchema = {
  $id: 'https://example.com/schemas/definitions.json',
  definitions: {
    user: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        name: { type: 'string' },
        age: { type: 'number', format: 'ageRange' },
      },
      required: ['name', 'age'],
      additionalProperties: false,
    }
  }
} as const;

const schema = {
  $id: 'https://example.com/schemas/user.json',
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    user: { $ref: 'definitions.json#/definitions/user' },
  },
  required: ['user'],
  additionalProperties: false,
} as const;

const payload = {
  user: {
    name: 'Alice',
    age: 25,
  },
};

const validatedData = validate({
  payload,
  schema,
  externalRefs: [definitionSchema],
  formats,
});
```
