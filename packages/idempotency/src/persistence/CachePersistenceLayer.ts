/**
 * Valkey and Redis OOS-compatible persistence layer for idempotency records.
 *
 * This class uses a cache client to write and read idempotency records. It supports any client that
 * implements the {@link CacheClient | `CacheClient`} interface.
 *
 * There are various options to configure the persistence layer, such as attribute names for storing
 * status, expiry, data, and validation keys in the cache.
 *
 * You must provide your own connected client instance by passing it through the `client` option.
 *
 * See the {@link https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda/typescript/latest/features/idempotency/ Idempotency documentation}
 * for more details on the configuration and usage patterns.
 *
 * **Using Valkey Glide Client**
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { GlideClient } from '@valkey/valkey-glide';
 * import { CachePersistenceLayer } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/idempotency/cache';
 *
 * const client = await GlideClient.createClient({
 *   addresses: [{
 *     host: process.env.CACHE_ENDPOINT,
 *     port: Number(process.env.CACHE_PORT),
 *   }],
 *   useTLS: true,
 * });
 *
 * const persistence = new CachePersistenceLayer({
 *   client,
 * });
 *
 * // ... your function handler here
 * ```
 *
 * **Using Redis Client**
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { createClient } from '@redis/client';
 * import { CachePersistenceLayer } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/idempotency/cache';
 *
 * const client = await createClient({
 *   url: `rediss://${process.env.CACHE_ENDPOINT}:${process.env.CACHE_PORT}`,
 *   username: 'default',
 * }).connect();
 *
 * const persistence = new CachePersistenceLayer({
 *   client,
 * });
 *
 * // ... your function handler here
 * ```
