## Follow-up Question: Persona Approach

**Your Answer to Q1**: "See next questions, no personas needed"

**Context**: You selected Job Story format (Q9: Answer B) which uses "When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome]" instead of persona-based format.

**Clarification Needed**: 

Job Stories can be written either:
- **With implicit personas**: Stories reference situations without naming specific user types
- **With explicit user types**: Stories reference user types in the situation (e.g., "When an API developer configures validation...")

**Question**: Should the Job Stories:

A) Use implicit personas (no user type references, focus on situations only)  
   Example: "When configuring validation for a route, I want to specify input and output schemas, so I can ensure data integrity"

B) Reference user types in situations (explicit user context)  
   Example: "When an API developer configures validation for a route, I want to specify input and output schemas, so I can ensure data integrity"

C) Skip persona documentation entirely but use generic "developer" in stories  
   Example: "When a developer configures validation..."

[Answer]: A

## Follow-up Question: Persona Documentation

**Question**: Should we still create a personas.md file for reference, even if not using classic persona-based story format?

A) Yes, create minimal personas.md with basic user types for context  
B) No, skip personas.md entirely since using Job Story format  
C) Create a "User Context" document instead of personas.md  

[Answer]: B
