## Powertools for AWS Lambda - MCP Server

> **Author: [Michael Walmsley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/walmsles/){target="_blank"} :material-linkedin:**

This project implements an MCP server that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to search through Powertools for AWS Lambda documentation.

The server accesses the live documentation `search_index.json` data and re-constructs a local search index using lunr.js. This provides an identical search experience for AI Agents and returns the exact same results as a person would get on the website.

With the index being local searches are super fast and the index is cached for the life of the server to save rebuilding used indexes. Since the MCP Server uses real search data it is capable of working for any Powertools for AWS document site so naturally supports all the runtimes.
