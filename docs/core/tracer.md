Tracer is an opinionated thin wrapper for [AWS X-Ray SDK for Node.js](https://github.com/aws/aws-xray-sdk-node).

![Tracer showcase](../media/tracer_utility_showcase.png)

## Key features

* Auto capture cold start and service name as annotations, and responses or full exceptions as metadata
* Auto-disable when not running in AWS Lambda environment
* Support tracing functions via decorators, middleware, and manual instrumentation
* Support tracing AWS SDK v2 and v3 via AWS X-Ray SDK for Node.js

## Getting started

### Permissions

Before your use this utility, your AWS Lambda function [must have permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-xray.html#services-xray-permissions) to send traces to AWS X-Ray.

> Example using AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)

=== "template.yml"

    ```yaml hl_lines="6 9"
    Resources:
      HelloWorldFunction:
        Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
        Properties:
          Runtime: nodejs14.x
          Tracing: Active
          Environment:
            Variables:
              POWERTOOLS_SERVICE_NAME: example
    ```

### Lambda handler

You can quickly start by importing the `Tracer` class, initialize it outside the Lambda handler, and instrument your function.

=== "Middleware"

    ```typescript hl_lines="1-2 4 7 9"
    import { Tracer } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/tracer';
    import middy from '@middy/core';

    const tracer = Tracer(); // Sets service via env var
    // OR tracer = Tracer({ service: 'example' });

    export const handler = middy(async (_event: any, _context: any) => {
        ...
    }).use(captureLambdaHandler(tracer));
    ```

=== "Decorator"

    ```typescript hl_lines="1 3 7"
    import { Tracer } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/tracer';

    const tracer = Tracer(); // Sets service via env var
    // OR tracer = Tracer({ service: 'example' });

    class Lambda {
        @tracer.captureLambdaHanlder()
        public handler(event: any, context: any) {
            ...
        }
    }
     
    export const handlerClass = new Lambda();
    export const handler = handlerClass.handler; 
    ```

=== "Manual"

    ```typescript hl_lines="1 3 7 9 11 17 20 24"
    import { Tracer } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/tracer';
    
    const tracer = Tracer(); // Sets service via env var
    // OR tracer = Tracer({ service: 'example' });

    export const handler = async (_event: any, context: any) => {
        const segment = tracer.getSegment(); // This is the facade segment (the one that is created by AWS Lambda)
        // Create subsegment for the function
        const handlerSegment = segment.addNewSubsegment(`## ${context.functionName}`);
        tracer.annotateColdStart();
        tracer.addServiceNameAnnotation();

        let res;
        try {
            res = ...
            // Add the response as metadata 
            tracer.addResponseAsMetadata(res, context.functionName);
        } catch (err) {
            // Add the error as metadata
            tracer.addErrorAsMetadata(err as Error);
        }
    
        // Close subsegment (the AWS Lambda one is closed automatically)
        handlerSegment.close();
    
        return res;
    }
    ```

When using the `captureLambdaHandler` decorator or middleware, Tracer performs these additional tasks to ease operations:

* Handles the lifecycle of the subsegment
* Creates a `ColdStart` annotation to easily filter traces that have had an initialization overhead
* Captures any response, or full exceptions generated by the handler, and include as tracing metadata

### Annotations & Metadata

**Annotations** are key-values associated with traces and indexed by AWS X-Ray. You can use them to filter traces and to create [Trace Groups](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/aws-xray-adds-the-ability-to-group-traces/) to slice and dice your transactions.

**Metadata** are key-values also associated with traces but not indexed by AWS X-Ray. You can use them to add additional context for an operation using any native object.

=== "Annotations"
	You can add annotations using `putAnnotation` method.

    ```typescript hl_lines="6"
    import { Tracer } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/tracer';
    
    const tracer = new Tracer({ serviceName: 'my-service' });
 
    export const handler = async (_event: any, _context: any) => {
        tracer.putAnnotation('PaymentStatus', "SUCCESS");
    }
    ```
=== "Metadata"
    You can add metadata using `putMetadata` method.

    ```typescript hl_lines="7"
    import { Tracer } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/tracer';

    const tracer = new Tracer({ serviceName: 'my-service' });

    export const handler = async (_event: any, _context: any) => {
        const res = someLogic();
        tracer.putMetadata('PaymentResponse', res);
    }
    ```

### Methods

You can trace other methods using the `captureMethod` decorator or manual instrumentation.

!!! info
    We currently support a middleware for tracing methods, [let us know](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools-typescript/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature-request%2C+triage&template=feature_request.md&title=) if you'd like to see one!

=== "Decorator"

    ```typescript hl_lines="6"
    import { Tracer } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/tracer';

    const tracer = Tracer();

    class Lambda {
        @tracer.captureMethod()
        public getChargeId(): string {
            ...
            return 'foo bar'
        }

        public handler(event: any, context: any) {
            const chargeId = this.getChargeId();
            const payment = collectPayment(chargeId);
            ...
        }
    }
     
    export const handlerClass = new Lambda();
    export const getChargeId = handlerClass.getChargeId;
    export const handler = handlerClass.handler; 
    ```

=== "Manual"

    ```typescript hl_lines="2 8-9 15 18 22"
    import { Tracer } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/tracer';
    import { Segment } from 'aws-xray-sdk-core';
    
    const tracer = new Tracer({ serviceName: 'my-service' });

    const chargeId = async () => {
        // Create subsegment & set it as active
        const subsegment = new Subsegment(`### chargeId`);
        tracer.setSegment(subsegment);

        let res;
        try {
            res = await someLogic(); // Do something
            // Add the response as metadata
            tracer.putMetadata(`chargeId response`, data);
        } catch (err) {
            // Add the error as metadata
            subsegment.addError(err, false);
        }

        // Close subsegment
        subsegment.close();
    
        return res;
    }

    export const handler = async (_event: any, _context: any) => {
        const chargeId = this.getChargeId();
        const payment = collectPayment(chargeId);
        ...
    }
    ```

## Advanced

### Patching AWS SDK clients

Tracer can patch [AWS SDK clients](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-sdk-nodejs-awssdkclients.html) and create traces when your application makes calls to AWS services.

!!! info
    The following snippet assumes you are using [**AWS SDK v3** for JavaScript](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/)

You can patch any AWS SDK clients by calling `captureAWSv3Client` method:

=== "index.ts"

    ```typescript hl_lines="6"
    import { S3Client } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";
    import { Tracer } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/tracer';

    const tracer = new Tracer();
    const client = new S3Client({});
    tracer.captureAWSv3Client(client);
    ```

!!! info
    The following two snippets assume you are using [**AWS SDK v2** for JavaScript](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/welcome.html)

You can patch all AWS SDK clients by calling `captureAWS` method:

=== "index.ts"

    ```typescript hl_lines="4"
    import { Tracer } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/tracer';

    const tracer = new Tracer();
    const AWS = tracer.captureAWS(require('aws-sdk'));
    ```

If you're looking to shave a few microseconds, or milliseconds depending on your function memory configuration, you can patch specific clients using `captureAWSClient`:

=== "index.ts"

    ```typescript hl_lines="5"
    import { S3 } from "aws-sdk";
    import { Tracer } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/tracer';

    const tracer = new Tracer();
    const s3 = tracer.captureAWSClient(new S3({ apiVersion: "2006-03-01" }));
    ```

### Disabling response auto-capture

Use **`POWERTOOLS_TRACER_CAPTURE_RESPONSE=false`** environment variable to instruct Tracer **not** to serialize function responses as metadata.

!!! info "This is commonly useful in three scenarios"

    1. You might **return sensitive** information you don't want it to be added to your traces
    2. You might manipulate **streaming objects that can be read only once**; this prevents subsequent calls from being empty
    3. You might return **more than 64K** of data _e.g., `message too long` error_

### Disabling exception auto-capture

Use **`POWERTOOLS_TRACER_CAPTURE_ERROR=false`** environment variable to instruct Tracer **not** to serialize exceptions as metadata.

!!! info "Commonly useful in one scenario"

    1. You might **return sensitive** information from exceptions, stack traces you might not control

### Escape hatch mechanism

You can use `tracer.provider` attribute to access all methods provided by the [AWS X-Ray SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray-sdk-for-nodejs/latest/reference/AWSXRay.html).

This is useful when you need a feature available in X-Ray that is not available in the Tracer utility, for example [SQL queries tracing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-sdk-nodejs-sqlclients.html), or [a custom logger](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-sdk-nodejs-configuration.html#xray-sdk-nodejs-configuration-logging).

=== "index.ts"

    ```typescript hl_lines="6"
    import { Logger } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/logger';
    import { Tracer } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/tracer';

    const logger = new Logger();
    const tracer = new Tracer()
    tracer.provider.setLogger(logger)
    ```

## Testing your code

Tracer is disabled by default when not running in the AWS Lambda environment - This means no code changes or environment variables to be set.

## Tips

- Use annotations on key operations to slice and dice traces, create unique views, and create metrics from it via Trace Groups
- Use a namespace when adding metadata to group data more easily
- Annotations and metadata are added to the current subsegment opened. If you want them in a specific subsegment, [create one](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-sdk-nodejs-subsegments.html#xray-sdk-nodejs-subsegments-lambda) via the escape hatch mechanism
