# Powertools for AWS Lambda (TypeScript)

Powertools for AWS Lambda (TypeScript) is a developer toolkit to implement Serverless [best practices and increase developer velocity](https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda/typescript/latest/#features).

You can use the library in both TypeScript and JavaScript code bases.

## Usage

The library provides a utility function to emit metrics to CloudWatch using [Embedded Metric Format (EMF)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Embedded_Metric_Format.html).

To get started, install the library by running:

```sh
npm i @aws-lambda-powertools/metrics
```

After initializing the Metrics class, you can add metrics using the [https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda/typescript/latest/core/metrics/#creating-metrics](`addMetric()`) method. The metrics are stored in a buffer and are flushed when calling [https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda/typescript/latest/core/metrics/#flushing-metrics](`publishStoredMetrics()`).

Each metric can also have dimensions and metadata added to it.

```ts
import { Metrics, MetricUnit } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/metrics';

const metrics = new Metrics({
  namespace: 'serverlessAirline',
  serviceName: 'orders',
  defaultDimensions: { environment: process.env.ENVIRONMENT },
});

export const handler = async (event: { requestId: string }) => {
  metrics.addMetadata('request_id', event.requestId);
  metrics.addMetric('successfulBooking', MetricUnit.Count, 1);
  metrics.publishStoredMetrics();
};
```

### Flushing metrics

As you finish adding all your metrics, you need to serialize and "flush them" by calling `publishStoredMetrics()`, which will emit the metrics to stdout in the Embedded Metric Format (EMF). The metrics are then picked up by the Lambda runtime and sent to CloudWatch.

The `publishStoredMetrics()` method is synchronous and will block the event loop until the metrics are flushed. If you want Metrics to flush automatically at the end of your Lambda function, you can use the `@logMetrics()` decorator or the `logMetrics()` middleware.

### Capturing cold start as a metric

With Metrics, you can capture cold start as a metric by calling the `captureColdStartMetric()` method. This method will add a metric with the name `ColdStart` and the value `1` to the metrics buffer.

This metric is flushed automatically as soon as the method is called, to ensure that the cold start is captured regardless of whether the metrics are flushed manually or automatically.

```ts
import { Metrics, MetricUnit } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/metrics';

const metrics = new Metrics({
  namespace: 'serverlessAirline',
  serviceName: 'orders',
});

export const handler = async (event: { requestId: string }) => {
  metrics.captureColdStartMetric();
};
```

Note that we don't emit a `ColdStart` metric with value `0` when the function is warm, as this would result in a high volume of metrics being emitted to CloudWatch, so you'll need to rely on the absence of the `ColdStart` metric to determine if the function is warm.

### Class method decorator

If you are using TypeScript and are comfortable with writing classes, you can use the `@logMetrics()` decorator to automatically flush metrics at the end of your Lambda function as well as configure additional options such as throwing an error if no metrics are added, capturing cold start as a metric, and more.

```ts
import type { Context } from 'aws-lambda';
import type { LambdaInterface } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/commons/types';
import { Metrics, MetricUnit } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/metrics';

const metrics = new Metrics({
  namespace: 'serverlessAirline',
  serviceName: 'orders',
});

class Lambda implements LambdaInterface {
  ⁣@metrics.logMetrics({ captureColdStartMetric: true, throwOnEmptyMetrics: true })
  public async handler(event: { requestId: string }, _: Context) {
    metrics.addMetadata('request_id', event.requestId);
    metrics.addMetric('successfulBooking', MetricUnit.Count, 1);
  }
}

const handlerClass = new Lambda();
export const handler = handlerClass.handler.bind(handlerClass);
```

Decorators are a Stage 3 proposal for JavaScript and are not yet part of the ECMAScript standard. The current implmementation in this library is based on the legacy TypeScript decorator syntax enabled by the [`experimentalDecorators` flag](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#experimentalDecorators) set to `true` in the `tsconfig.json` file.

### Middy.js middleware

If instead you are using [Middy.js](http://middy.js.org) and prefer to use middleware, you can use the `@logMetrics()` middleware to do the same as the class method decorator.

The `@logMetrics()` middleware can be used with Middy.js to automatically flush metrics at the end of your Lambda function as well as configure additional options such as throwing an error if no metrics are added, capturing cold start as a metric, and set default dimensions.

```ts
import { Metrics, MetricUnit } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/metrics';
import { logMetrics } from '@aws-lambda-powertools/metrics/middleware';
import middy from '@middy/core';

const metrics = new Metrics({
  namespace: 'serverlessAirline',
  serviceName: 'orders',
});

export const handler = middy(async (event) => {
  metrics.addMetadata('request_id', event.requestId);
  metrics.addMetric('successfulBooking', MetricUnit.Count, 1);
}).use(logMetrics(metrics, {
  captureColdStartMetric: true,
  throwOnEmptyMetrics: true,
}));
```

The `logMetrics()` middleware is compatible with `@middy/core@3.x` and above.
